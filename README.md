# DS Malik Intro to C++ programming book (5th ed.) solutions

This repo contains the solutions of various programming problems included in the mentioned in the book. Not all of the problems were solved but rather the ones that I was able to do or deemed important to do. Also I believe the last 3 chapters of the book have not been done by me as well.
